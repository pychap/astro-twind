# A little bit about me, my skills, the path my life has taken.

Hard to believe that some time back I started on my career path as a cook üë®‚Äçüç≥ ‚Äì in the Coast Guard. After my service stint I got into Architecture School at Arizona State, changed my major after a few years and graduated with a degree in Industrial Technology, Graphic Communications.  

After being in the workforce with my degree for about 6 years, I enrolled in a Multimedia Design program at Platt College. I think that this was the pivotal moment in my life as I found I could digitally make and design things like I dreamed of in Architecture school. And, if I wanted to change what I made, I could do it instantly.

## The designer

Now I could apply my design sensibilities! In my next series of jobs I was designing for print, for web, and for Multimedia. I was learning to love all the challenges of design in a limited canvas (paper, web page), and I was taking classes at San Diego City college ‚Äì taught by accomplished local designers, learning to love typography as well.

During this phase I honed my Photoshop, Lightroom skills and combined with my Photography hobby became a bit of a Ninja.
