# A bit about me.

### The cook
Hard to believe that some time back I started on my career path as a cook üë®‚Äçüç≥. It started as a line cook in a Prime Rib restaurant after high school. After High School I joined the Coast Guard and got pretty robust culinary training, made top of the class! After the Coast Guard I had to make a decision: I liked cooking but I wanted to go further in my schooling. So when I got out and having some previous architecture exposure, I enrolled into Architecture School at Arizona State. I didn't end up with Architecture for various reason, instead graduating with a degree in Industrial Technology, Graphic Communications. 

After being in the workforce with my degree for about 6 years, I enrolled in a Multimedia Design program at Platt College. I think that this was the pivotal moment in my life as I found I could digitally make and design things like I dreamed of in Architecture school. And, if I wanted to change what I made, I could do it instantly.

### The designer

Now I could apply my design sensibilities! In my next series of jobs I was designing for print, for web, and for Multimedia. I was learning to love all the challenges of design in a limited canvas (paper, web page), and I was taking classes at San Diego City college ‚Äì taught by accomplished local designers, learning to love typography as well.

During this phase I honed my Photoshop, Lightroom skills and combined with my Photography hobby became a bit of a Ninja.
